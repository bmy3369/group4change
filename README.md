# group4change
Hello!
We are group4change, a volunteering web service that allows people to get involved within their community in a variety of ways.
Instead of spending money for initiatives you are interested in, you spend your own time through volunteering.
Users will be able to volunteer their time to different community events created by other members of the community.
People can start an initiative to do some type of volunteer activity which people can see on a list or map and be able to attend the event.
Have fun volunteering and change your community over time!
